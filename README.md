Stylish Modal Window
This is an implementation of a stylish modal window in a generic web page, designed to explore and grasp the concepts of manipulating CSS classes using JavaScript.

Custom functions were developed to seamlessly open and close the modal window by toggling the presence of a 'hidden' CSS class on the modal window element. Additionally, an event listener was incorporated to enable the closure of the modal window upon pressing the Escape key.

This project was undertaken as a valuable learning exercise within the JavaScript course instructed by Jonas Schmedtmann.

Features
The stylish modal window encompasses the following notable features:

Effortless opening and closing of the modal window through the dynamic manipulation of CSS classes.
Automatic closure of the modal window upon pressing the Escape key, courtesy of the event listener.
